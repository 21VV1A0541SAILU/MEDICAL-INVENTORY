# Medical Inventory Optimization System
# Project Overview

The Medical Inventory Optimization System is designed to streamline and improve the management of medical inventory in healthcare facilities. It leverages historical sales and inventory data to provide insights into stock levels, optimize order quantities, reduce waste, and enhance decision-making. This project uses data analytics to help healthcare providers ensure timely availability of medical supplies while minimizing costs and stockouts.

# Key Features

- **Data Collection**: Gathered from various sources such as pharmacy sales systems, billing data, and hospital inventory databases.
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Includes handling missing values, removing duplicates, standardizing formats, and feature engineering.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Provides insights through visualizations and statistical summaries, identifying key trends, correlations, and anomalies.
- **Inventory Optimization Algorithms**: Calculates reorder points, safety stock, and optimizes stock levels to avoid both excess inventory and stockouts.
- **Data Visualization**: Uses Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to create clear visual representations of trends in inventory and sales data.
- **Reporting and Decision Support**: Generates detailed reports to assist healthcare administrators in making informed, data-driven decisions regarding inventory management.

# Technologies Used

- **Python** for data analysis and modeling
- **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data cleaning and preprocessing
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for visualizations
- **SQL** (or equivalent database systems) for data storage
- **Jupyter Notebooks** for interactive analysis
- **Git** for version control

# Project Architecture

1. **Data Collection**: Inventory and sales data are collected from various hospital systems.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Cleaning the raw data to ensure consistency and accuracy.
3. **Database Loading**: Data is stored in a centralized database for easy access and processing.
4. **EDA & Visualization**: Generating insights through descriptive statistics and visual representations.
5. **Inventory Optimization**: Applying algorithms to determine optimal stock levels and reorder points.
6. **Decision Making**: Providing actionable insights for inventory management through automated reports and dashboards.

# Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/medical-inventory-optimization.git
   ```
2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
